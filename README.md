Kyval is a simple key-value store based on LibSQL. This project is a fork of [Keyv Rust][keyv-rust],
originally created by [Christian Llontop][chrisllontop]. By utilizing LibSQL, Kyval offers a lightweight
and flexible alternative for simple data storage needs.

**Main changes:** The primary difference between Kyval and the original Keyv Rust is the use of
LibSQL as the database backend, replacing SQLite. This change enables Kyval to have improved
flexibility in data storage.
